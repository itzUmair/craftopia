Open a terminal (make sure it is command prompt not powershell) in the project directory
Type pip install virtualenv
once installed, type

virtualenv venv

then:

venv/Scripts/activate.bat

after that,

Type pip install -r requirements.txt

this will install all the dependancies

Once all the dependencies are installed,
type in the terminal:

uvicorn main:app --reload

this will start the server.
to close the server, click in the terminal and press CTRL+C, the server will close. If it gets stuck, reopen the terminal

after you are done with your development, type

You have to run
